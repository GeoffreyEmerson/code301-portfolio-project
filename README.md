Day 1 User Stories:

- [x] As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
- [x] As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.
- [ ] As a developer, I need portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
- [ ] As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.
- [x] As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
- [ ] As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive with a menu, so that I can get around using any device.
- [x] As a hiring manager, I want to quickly be able to assess whether I should contact the developer to set up an interview, based on web development skills shown on the site.
- [x] As a visitor, I want to see projects one per row on mobile, so that I can read the detail easily.

Day 1 Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

- [x] Be sure to use proper viewport settings.
- [x] Use mobile-first design principles when adding CSS.
- [ ] Add new styles in any media queries as needed to make the page look good on desktop screens.


Day 2 User Stories:

- [ ] As a developer, I want portfolio items to be displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
- [x] As a visitor, I want the portfolio to show the newest projects on top so that I can easily see the developers recent work.
- [ ] As a visitor, I want relative timestamps on projects to give me a idea of how many days ago something was created.

Day 2 Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

- [ ] Develop on a new git branch, and merge only working code back to master using a PR.
- [ ] Use good Object Oriented code: Create a constructor function for projects.
- [ ] Leave as little in the window (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.
- [ ] Use jQuery's .clone() to create new articles, and fill them in with content.
- [ ] Your Project prototype should have a .toHtml() function that adds new data to the DOM.
- [ ] Make your app look good; include basic styles: a css reset, portions of content centered in the page, reasonable margins, etc.
